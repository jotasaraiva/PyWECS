# Wavelet Energies Correlation Screening (WECS)

This project has a Python implementation of the WECS methodology for Change Detection in time series of SAR images as mentioned in the article [Wavelet Spatio-Temporal Change Detection on Multitemporal SAR Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10105998). The code is inspired by the [original MATLAB implementation](https://github.com/rodneyfv/WECS/tree/main).
